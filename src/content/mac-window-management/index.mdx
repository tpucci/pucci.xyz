spoiler: Controlling my mac window positions and tiling.
---

Having clean Spaces on my mac increases my productivity. Indeed, I am pleased to see all my windows well organized on my screen:

- no information hides in some app that is behind another;
- I focus on what windows are important to my task;

Looking for a window on another screen or another Space is a waste.

# Organize your Spaces

A Space is a virtual desktop on mac.

## Use 5 Spaces (at most)

I use 5 Spaces on my mac:

- 1st: my chats - whatsapp, slack, teams
- 2nd: internet browser - chrome
- 3rd: my IDE
- 4th: debugging tools
- 5th: my other Space for more debugging

Why ?

- Manage stuff, organize, plan, collaborate: I switch between the 1st and 2nd Spaces.
- Code: I switch between internet (browsing docs and GitHub) and my IDE.
- Debug: I switch between 3rd and 4th or 5th Space.

Each Space is next to a relevant neighbor.

<LetSPairProgram />

## Stop your mac from rearranging Spaces

On a mac, as you might know, you can use virtual Spaces. Spaces reorganize when you switch to some application. Magically. The most recent app's Space goes next to the previous one.
To disable this horrible default setting, either:

- open your settings > mission control > untick Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use;
- run the following command in a terminal.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock mru-desktops -bool false
```

## Do NOT use fullscreen mode

Clicking on the green button on a window makes it fullscreen. Fullscreen lets you focus on one window only. Perhaps two if you use Side-by-side views. However, this has two cons:

- setting fullscreen side-by-side view is time-consuming;
- it moves the fullscreen Space at the right end of the Spaces, breaking your organization.

# Organize your windows with Amethyst

Amethyst is [available on Github](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst).

## Why Ametyst and not Spectacle or other window manager ?

Amethyst is the quickest way to bring the layout I have in mind to life.

Spectacle or other window manager offer window positionning.
Amethyst offers window layout.

Spectacle is like positioning all HTML divs in absolute mode.
Amethyst is like tiling elements in flex mode.

## How to use Amethyst ?

You just need 5 shortcuts to become a window ninja.

- A window has two states: float or tile.
  - Toggle float for focused window with `option+shit+t`
- A Space can have several layouts but you only need two:
  - Select tall layout with `option+shit+a`
  - Select fullscreen layout with `option+shit+d`
- The tall layout has a main pane that can be resized:
  - Expand the main pane with `option+shift+l`
  - Decrease the main pane with `option+shift+h`

# Homework

Thats's the theory ! Are you ready to manage your mac windows like a Pro ?

1. Disable Spaces autoarrange in your settings.
2. Create 5 Spaces and stick to it !
3. Sort your windows on those Spaces :
   - chats on the 1st Space,
   - browsers on the 2nd,
   - code on the 3rd,
   - everything that helps you check and debug your code results on the 4th and 5th.
4. Install [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst).
5. Play with the 5 commands above ðŸŽ‰
