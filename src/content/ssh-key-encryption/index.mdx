# Encrypt your keys

Use the command :

```
ssh-keygen -p -f /Users/thomaspucci/.ssh/id_rsa_something
```

You will be prompt for your password.

# Save your password somewhere safe

I personnaly use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com).

# Change your .ssh/config

Add `UseKeychain` to authorize the agent to store and get the key password from the keychain.

```
───────┬──────────────────────────────
       │ File: config
───────┼──────────────────────────────
   1   │ Host *
   2   │  AddKeysToAgent yes
   3   │  UseKeychain yes
```

# Try to pull a project

You will be asked for your password.
Type it or copy-paste-it.
It will be saved in the keychain and you will not be asked for it again.
